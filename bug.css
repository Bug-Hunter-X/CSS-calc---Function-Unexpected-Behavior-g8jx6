The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit consistency. For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(50% - 10);` might not, because the second `10` lacks units.  Another issue is nested `calc()` functions, which can become hard to read and debug.
